/*
A hash map is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash map uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
It is usually organized as a key-value pair, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. Hash maps are commonly used for fast data retrieval, as they allow for average-case constant time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.

Linked lists are a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as well as dynamic memory allocation. Linked lists can be singly linked (where each element points to the next) or doubly linked (where each element points to both the next and previous elements).
The time complexity for accessing an element in a linked list is O(n) in the worst case, as it may require traversing the entire list to find the desired element. However, insertion and deletion operations can be performed in O(1) time if the position is known.
